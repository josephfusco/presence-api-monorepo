#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# includes/db-viewer.php and the includes/debugger-*.php files are WP_DEBUG-only
# developer tools, excluded from measurement/distribution in three places:
#
#   - .distignore        keeps them out of the distributed zip
#   - phpunit.xml.dist   keeps them out of PHPUnit coverage
#   - codecov.yml        keeps them out of the Codecov report
#
# Nothing enforces that the three lists agree. If phpunit.xml.dist excludes a
# file that codecov.yml does not, Codecov reports it as 0% covered and drags
# the project total down for a file deliberately left unmeasured. This script
# fails unless phpunit.xml.dist and codecov.yml exclude the same includes/*.php
# files and every one in .distignore is among them; the two lists can also hold
# files that ship but cannot be measured, such as the default-filters files.
#
# Called from .github/workflows/phpcs.yml. Also runnable locally:
#
#   bash scripts/check-debug-exclusions.sh
