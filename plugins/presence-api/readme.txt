System-wide presence and awareness for WordPress.

== Description ==

Presence API gives WordPress a system-wide awareness layer. It tracks which users are logged in, which admin screen they are on, and which posts they are editing.

Data flows through the Heartbeat API and is stored in a dedicated `wp_presence` table with a 150-second TTL. No writes to `wp_postmeta` means no post-cache invalidation on every heartbeat.

On a multisite network, Network Admin gets its own view of the same data: a Who's Online dashboard widget listing the busiest sites and who is on each, an Online column in the Sites list, and an Online view, filter, and column in the Users list. These require the `manage_network` capability.


= Features =

* Admin bar indicator showing who's online and who's on this page
* Active Posts dashboard widget grouped by post
* Editors column in the post list
* Online filter in the Users list
* AI agents labelled in Who's Online, the admin bar, and the Editors column, once a plugin such as Agent Users marks them

= For Developers =

PHP functions, REST endpoints, WP-CLI commands, filters, and room conventions are documented in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/WordPress/presence-api).

= Background =

A feature plugin sponsored by the WordPress Core team, exploring what system-wide presence could look like for a future WordPress release. Follow development on [make.wordpress.org/core](https://make.wordpress.org/core/) with the tag `#presence-api`.

== Installation ==

1. In your WordPress admin, go to **Plugins → Add New Plugin** and search for "Presence API", then click **Install Now**.
2. Activate through the **Plugins** menu.

Or install manually:

1. Download the zip and upload the `presence-api` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate through the **Plugins** menu.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it work on multisite? =

Yes. Network-activate it and Network Admin gains a Who's Online dashboard widget listing the busiest sites and who is on each, an Online column in the Sites list, and an Online view, filter, and column in the Users list. Every site keeps its own widgets and lists, counting only the people on that site.

= Who can see network-wide presence? =

Anyone with the `manage_network` capability, which on a default network means super admins. The `wp_presence_network_capability` filter changes what is required.

= Can a site stop recording presence? =

Yes. Clear the **Presence** checkbox on Settings > General, or run `wp presence recording set off`. Every screen empties within one TTL as the rows already stored expire. On multisite, Network Admin > Settings has the same checkbox for every site at once; whichever switch is off decides.

For code, the `wp_presence_recording_enabled` and `wp_presence_network_recording_enabled` filters take the checkboxes as their defaults, so a filter always has the last word.
