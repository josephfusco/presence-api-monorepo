 * Reading who is online across a network means reading every site's presence
 * table, and there is no way to do that from one site without switching into
 * each of them. The alternative is one shared, network-wide summary table
 * holding a row per site, so the network can be read with a single query
 * against a single table.
 *
 * Each site keeps its own row current, pushing a snapshot of who is online
 * there whenever its presence data changes, so nothing has to go looking.
 *
 * The table is registered as an ms_global_tables entry on $wpdb->base_prefix
 * (see schema.php, which also creates it), the same way core registers blogs
 * and sitemeta, so it is created once per network rather than once per site.
 *
 * Reading splits in two. The snapshot is one query returning user IDs and
 * nothing else, and it is what most callers want. Resolving those IDs into
 * display names and avatar URLs is the part that costs, and no surface draws
 * every user online, so callers ask the summary for the slice they are about
 * to render rather than taking the whole network and cutting it afterwards.
